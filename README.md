## Building and training a MLP from scratch


Attempting to build and train a MLP network from scratch (no ML libraries such as Tensorflow or Pytorch).
This project was heavily inspired by [Samson Zhang's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&t=300s). The network built follows a very internal structure while adding another layer and extra neurons at each layer due to the higher complexity of the training data.
The model was trained on the [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist](Sign Language MNIST dataset found on Kaggle).
The code for the network is defined in the 'mlp.py' script while the training and testing along with the comments and analysis of the results can be found in the 'training.ipynb' notebook.
